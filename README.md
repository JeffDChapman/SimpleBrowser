Stripped Down web Browser

C# based on MS Edge

After initial background execution of scripts when visiting a web site, this software removes all scripts, images, and formatting to show just the text and links on a website.

To download just the runtime, copy the URL "https://github.com/JeffDChapman/SimpleBrowser/tree/SimpleBrowser/Runtime", navigate to https://download-directory.github.io/ and paste the URL into the text box, and hit enter.
